Snake Mania is an upgraded version of the classic Snake game, developed in C++ using the Raylib library. It enhances gameplay with a graphical border, randomly placed hurdles, and dynamic food placement, making it more challenging and engaging. Players control the snake to consume food while avoiding obstacles and the boundaries. The game's smooth mechanics, modern visuals, and unpredictable challenges create a fresh experience while maintaining the nostalgic essence of the original. The addition of hurdles increases difficulty, requiring strategic movement. With Raylib’s efficient rendering, Snake Mania delivers a visually appealing and responsive gaming experience for all players.
